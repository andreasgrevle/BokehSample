# Bokeh Visualization Samples

A comprehensive collection of Bokeh visualization examples for learning purposes. This repository contains progressively complex examples from basic plots to advanced interactive dashboards.

## üìÅ Files Overview

- **`01_basic_plots.py`** - Fundamental plotting types (line, scatter, bar, area charts)
- **`02_interactive_plots.py`** - Interactive features with widgets and callbacks
- **`03_dashboard_layouts.py`** - Complex layouts and dashboard examples
- **`04_advanced_plots.py`** - Sophisticated visualizations (heatmaps, network graphs)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Examples

Each Python file can be run independently to generate HTML visualizations:

```bash
# Basic plots
python 01_basic_plots.py

# Interactive plots
python 02_interactive_plots.py

# Dashboard layouts
python 03_dashboard_layouts.py

# Advanced plots
python 04_advanced_plots.py
```

Each script will generate an HTML file that you can open in your web browser to view the interactive visualizations.

## üìä What You'll Learn

### Basic Plots (`01_basic_plots.py`)
- Line plots with multiple series
- Scatter plots with hover tooltips
- Bar charts with styling
- Area plots and filled regions
- Plot layouts and arrangements

### Interactive Plots (`02_interactive_plots.py`)
- Real-time updates with JavaScript callbacks
- Widget integration (sliders, buttons)
- Selection and highlighting
- Linked data tables
- Cross-filtering between plots

### Dashboard Layouts (`03_dashboard_layouts.py`)
- Financial dashboard with multiple chart types
- Sales analytics with heatmaps and pie charts
- Tabbed interfaces
- Grid layouts and responsive design

### Advanced Plots (`04_advanced_plots.py`)
- Correlation heatmaps with annotations
- Network graph visualizations
- Color mapping and scales
- Complex data transformations

## üéØ Key Bokeh Concepts Covered

- **Basic Plotting**: `figure()`, line renderers, scatter plots
- **Interactivity**: Widgets, callbacks, selection tools
- **Layouts**: `column()`, `row()`, `gridplot()`, tabs
- **Data Sources**: `ColumnDataSource` for dynamic updates
- **Styling**: Colors, palettes, themes, annotations
- **Advanced Features**: Color mapping, network graphs, custom tools

## üí° Tips for Learning

1. **Start with basics** - Run `01_basic_plots.py` first to understand fundamentals
2. **Experiment** - Modify parameters and see how they affect the visualizations
3. **Read the code** - Each file is well-commented to explain concepts
4. **Check the HTML** - Open generated HTML files to see interactive features
5. **Build incrementally** - Use these examples as starting points for your own projects
